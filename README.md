# Machine_learning_prediction_Model
Repository contains two code file: one is a model prediction done taking 38 features and other is model prediction done taking 20 features
Project Introduction:
Our project has proteome plasma data of 51 COVID-19 infected patients with patients classified as COVID-19 Non-severe & COVID-19 Severe.
Our project aims to classify severity levels of such samples with the help of supervised machine learning models.
We build many ML models, out of all Linear SVM model was giving the highest accuracy of > 0.9.
We trained our data with a linear SVM model, and then validated and tested for the accuracy.
Project usefulness:
Machine learning is rapidly growing and has shown tremendous application in medical advances. From our study, we concluded that such methods could be established to distinguish a given COVID-19 sample as a Severe or a Non-severe. We also discovered few features which were singularly giving good accuracy, and such features can be recognised as potential Biomarkers in drug designing.
How to use:
Code has been deposited and made publicly available at GitHub. 
Users need first to download proteom data file (Supplementary section of the paper) then insert that data file location in <input data section> in the code.
Help or assistance while using the project:
All the necessary information: library, plots, model working, is explained clearly at https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html
